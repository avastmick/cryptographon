**What is this?**

It's a set of code examples and games to show kids (or adults) the principles behind cryptography.

**Why?**

My two young girls (nine and ten-years old) were playing a game. They'd created their own simple [Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher) where their secret messages were encoded into numbers.

So, I had an idea. They were very excited about their secrets and making it easier to send their messages. I was very keen on them learning so code. I agreed to set something up so they could write their messages by writing code.

## Step One

Turning their cipher into code.

# Welcome to Cryptographon

Cryptographon is a site that intends to help people (particularly kids) about encryption and cryptography. By using simple scenarios, code and easy steps, it takes the reader and user all the way to high-grade encryption techniques.

Please feel free to contribute and point out any errors, or simply suggest where we could do a better job!

*This is a simple holding page for now as the project is only just initialising.*
